# Chat Site Todos

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add an online view to see what users are online
  - Could be done by pinging all clients when someone joins then having them return a value with their user id, posting it to an online view
- [ ] Add a "typing..." to the text box
  - Same idea as above, onFocusChange
- [ ] Servers - Chatrooms - DM's


## Now Plans

- [ ] Move the databases together and change how favoriteColor, username, etc. is supplied to each message
- [ ] Make the client's update the messages when a message is deleted
